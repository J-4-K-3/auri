          This summary provides an overview of Auri's key policies and
          practices. Users must create an account to access the platform. They
          are responsible for maintaining secure login credentials and may
          request account deletion at any time. The community guidelines cover
          content creation, interaction, and moderation, including restrictions
          on harmful or inappropriate content and the use of AI and human
          moderation to maintain safety. Auri may connect with other Innoxation
          apps for optional features, but user data is handled carefully,
          collected only as necessary, and never sold to third parties. Security
          measures, data retention practices, and protections for younger users
          are in place, and users have rights to access, correct, or delete
          their data. Third-party services are used only for specific functions
          like Auri Shop item management, payment processing, and delivery. The
          platform may receive updates or changes, and support is available for
          questions regarding account management, content, or privacy. Expand
          the sections below for complete details.
